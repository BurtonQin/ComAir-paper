\section{Production-Run Algorithmic Profiling}
\label{sec:online}

In this section, we discuss our design and 
implementation for online algorithmic profiling. 
For production-run usage, 
it is very important to keep a low runtime overhead, 
since end users cannot tolerate any perceived slowdown.  

For production-run techniques, 
sampling is a widely used technique to lower runtime overhead.
Since less information is collected in one single run,
sampling usually relies on information collected from 
multiple runs to achieve the same capability.
