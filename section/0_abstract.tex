Complexity problems are one common type of performance problems, 
caused by algorithmic inefficiency. 
Algorithmic profiling aims to attribute complexity to a code construct.
It can detect previously unknown complexity problems and diagnose performance failures 
caused by complexity problems. 
Existing techniques on algorithmic profiling 
will incur more than $30$ times runtime overhead,
and cannot be deployed in production runs, missing opportunities to understand 
real-world workloads and how programs scale in the user side. 

In this paper, we present a toolchain \Tool, 
which can effectively conduct algorithmic profiling. 
To design \Tool, we first conduct an empirical study on 
real-world complexity problems from a representative performance-bug benchmark suit. 
Guided by our study, 
we then explore different 
design points during algorithmic profiling.
Finally, we apply sampling to lower runtime 
overhead and enable the production-run usage for \Tool.
Experimental results show that \Tool 
can cover different types of complexity problems, 
generate accurate profiling results, 
and incur a very low runtime overhead.
