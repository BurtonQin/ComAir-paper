Complexity problems are a common type of performance problems, 
and they are caused by algorithmic inefficiency. 
Algorithmic profiling aims to attribute complexity to a code construct.
It can detect previously unknown complexity problems and diagnose performance failures 
caused by complexity problems. 
Existing algorithmic profiling techniques
incur more than $30$ times runtime overhead,
and cannot be deployed in production runs, missing opportunities to understand 
real-world workloads and how programs scale on the user side. 

In this paper, we present a toolchain, \Tool, 
which can effectively conduct algorithmic profiling. 
To design \Tool, we first conduct an empirical study on 
real-world complexity problems from a representative performance-bug benchmark suite. 
Guided by our study, 
we then explore different 
design points of algorithmic profiling.
Finally, we apply sampling to lower the runtime 
overhead and enable \Tool to be used in production runs.
Our experimental results show that \Tool 
can cover different types of complexity problems, 
generate accurate profiling results, 
and incur a very low runtime overhead.
