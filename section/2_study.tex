\section{Understanding Real-World Complexity Bugs}
\label{sec:study}


In this section, we conduct an empirical study on real-world complexity bugs. 
Specifically, we try to answer the following two questions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item What are common root causes for complexity bugs? 
Here, we consider code constructs conducting computation in unexpected complexity as root causes. 
Studying root causes can help us understand whether or not 
existing algorithmic profiling algorithms work on real-world bugs 
and can also guide the design of new approximate algorithms. 

\item How real-world complexity bugs are reported, diagnosed, and fixed?
This can help us understand the state of practice of combating process for complexity bugs. 

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Methodology}
\label{sec:meth}

We conduct our empirical study based on a public benchmark set for 
real-world performance bugs~\cite{PerfBug,SongOOPSLA2014}. 
In the previous work~\cite{PerfBug}, 
the authors collected 110 real-world performance bugs from 5 representative 
software suites, which are Apache, Chrome, GCC, Mozilla, and MySQL. 
These software suites cover various types of functionalities and are implemented 
by different programming languages, including C/C++, Java, C\#, and JavaScript. 
These software suites are all large and mature, 
with millions of lines of codes and long development histories. 
In their following work~\cite{SongOOPSLA2014}, 
the authors further identified 65 user-perceived performance bugs, 
which are all observed and reported by users. 


Our study focuses on user-perceived performance bugs, 
since these bugs have large performance impact.
After carefully reading bug reports and buggy code fragments of these bugs,
we clearly identify \ComBugs performance problems 
caused by {\textit{unexpected algorithmic complexity}}.
These performance problems will be referred to as 
{\textit{complexity problems}} in the reminder of this paper.


{\bf{\textit{Caveats.}}}
The same as all previous empirical studies, 
our findings and conclusions need to be considered together with our methodology.
All studied complexity bugs come from representative software. 
However, there are other types of software not covered in our study, 
such as distributed systems and HPC software. 
All studied complexity problems are reported by users through bug tracking systems.  
We do believe that there are complexity problems noticed 
and fixed by developers in other ways. 
However, there are no conceivable methods to study them.
We believe that the studied complexity problems can serve as a representative sample
of complexity problems in the real world.
