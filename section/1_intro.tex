Why we need algorithmic profiling? 

Why we need to push complexity profiling to production runs? 
a. Understanding real-world workload
b. Identifying performance bugs caused by API-misuse

The state of the art cannot be applied to production runs. 

Contributions:
a. Empirical study on real-world complexity bugs
b. A thorough study on conducting algorithmic profiling during in-house testing
c. Approximate algorithm to conduct algorithmic profiling in production runs.
