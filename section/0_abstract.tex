Complexity problems are a common type of performance problems, 
caused by algorithmic inefficiency. 
Algorithmic profiling aims to attribute complexity to a code construct.
It can detect previously unknown complexity problems and diagnose performance failures 
caused by complexity problems. 

In this paper, we present \Tool, a tool chain, 
which can effectively conduct algorithmic profiling. 
To design \Tool, we first conduct an empirical study on 
real-world complexity problems in a representative performance-bug benchmark set. 
Guided by our study, 
we then explore different design points during algorithmic profiling.
Finally, we apply sampling to lower runtime overhead and enable the production-run usage for \Tool.
Experimental results show that \Tool can cover different types of complexity problems, 
generate accurate profiling results, and incur a low runtime overhead.
